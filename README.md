## Rules:
The goal is to destroy your opponents tank by hitting them with your tank shell.
Each player takes turns; on a player's turn they can move and adjust the angle and power of their shot.
Once the player fires, their turn ends and the other player's turn begins.
Turns are timed and if you do not fire within that time limit, you do not get to fire.
Each player has 100 health and a shell impact deals 25 damage.
